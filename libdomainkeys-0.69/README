INSTALLATION

 C lib build
'make' will create libdomainkeys.a and domainkeys.h.

Or else it won't.

Python module build
'make python' will build the python wrapper and shared object (_domainkeys.so)

Common problems with the build:

If it can't find the openssl include files, you
might need to add a -I pointing to them to INCS variable in the Makefile.
In addition, you may have to add an -L to the the LIBS variable to point to the
path for the crypto lib.

Problems in "dns_text" with undefined refrences. Odds are the makefile failed
to correctly setup the dns.lib file so the easy fix is to do this:
	echo "-lresolv" > dns.lib; make
that should build the dktest binary.

Unixware users may need to add -DUNIXWARE to the CFLAGS variable in the make file to
make a compatable header file for cc (not gcc) on that platform.

WIN32

Visual Studio 2003 Project files are included and configured to create
lib or dll in debug or release mode. OpenSSL is required and your environment
must be configured to find the openssl include files and pre-compiled library
from where they are. In Visual Studio, see Tools/Options/Projects/VC++
Directories.

USAGE

See dktest.html and dknewkey.html.

TESTING

The program named 'test' will execute a number of test cases.

./test

It should only print the test case numbers.  If it prints anything
else, then that test failed.

ERRATA

None known.

DOCUMENTATION

Read domainkeys.h.  If you need more information than it has,
then I need to write more.
